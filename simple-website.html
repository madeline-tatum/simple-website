        <p>My experience with this movie is one of great sorrow. The movie follows two siblings, <b>Seita</b> and his little sister <b>Setsuko</b>. Their village has been bombed by American jets in the middle of a WWII and they end up losing both of their parents to the war as well. The only place they have to go is an estranged aunt who ridicules everything Seita does. They end up leaving and attempting to live on their own in an abandoned bomb shelter. They say that during war, you can't survive outside of the system. This is very true for these two siblings. Unable to obtain food without stealing, they both become extremely malnurished and Setsuko becomes sick. She does not last long, leaving Seita alone. He dies shortly after her.</p>

        <p>The only thing gained from this movie is emotional trauma. Don't get me wrong, the story and art are both gorgeous, <b>HOWEVER</b> it is the most heart wrenching thing I have laid my eyes upon.</p>

        <h3>1000/10</h3><p><b>BUT</b> this movie is not for the faint of heart or the overly sensitive.</p>
